## How to run

To run this project, one must follow these steps:

- Start an HTTP local server in the root folder of the project, containing the source code and the CGF library.
- Start a SICStus Prolog instance, inside the `greener_api/` folder
- Consult the server file with the following command `['server'].` 
- Run the command `server.` to start the Prolog connection.

**Note:** The last three steps may also be performed by running the `start.bat` script.

## Game rules

Players take turns (starting by Black âš«) capturing pyramids or stacks of any colour orthogonally (on the same row or collumn and with no stacks between them). On your turn you must make one capture if possible, otherwise you pass the turn. The game ends when all players pass in succession. The player with the most green pyramids captured (being part of stacks they control) wins the game.
