## Project information

- All of the specified primitives were done and support any kind of texture, material, transformation and 
instantiation. 
- Our parser handles all kinds of errors that may occur, giving warnings and assuming default values for missing components.

### Scene
- Our [scene](scenes/LAIG_TP1_XML_T3_04.xml) consists in a representation of Star Wars IV's part in which the character C-3P0 and R2-D2 are in the desert planet of Tatooine.
- For the sake of simplicity, we decided not to represent C-3P0 and instead focus on the details of R2-D2.
- As R2-D2 is already a complex structure, extreme details are hard to implement here due to limitations on the primitives, so the R2-D2 represented is simplified to give the main charm of the robot, instaed of the full package.

## Issues/Problems

- There wasn't any problem detected while testing with other groups XML's.
