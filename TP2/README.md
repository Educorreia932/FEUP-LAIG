## Project information

- All of the specified primitives were done and support any kind of texture, material, transformation, animation and 
instantiation. 
- Our parser handles all kinds of errors that may occur, giving warnings and assuming default values for missing components and is organized into multiple parts.

### Scene
- Our [scene](scenes/LAIG_TP1_XML_T3_04.xml) consists in a representation of Star Wars IV's part in which the character R2-D2 is stranded in the desert planet of Tatooine.
- More precisely, it represents a section of the movie that didn't make it to the final cut where the robot walks into a rock, triping over it and subconsequently damaging its internal circuits (poor R2-D2).
- As R2-D2 is already a complex structure, extreme details are hard to implement here due to limitations on the primitives, so the R2-D2 represented is simplified to give the main charm of the robot, insteadd of the full package.
